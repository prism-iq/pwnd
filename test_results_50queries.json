After leaving office, Bill Clinton continued to be a significant political figure. In the 2016 presidential campaign, there were debates and discussions about Bill and Hillary Clinton's roles in politics, particularly regarding allegations of profiting from public office made by then-candidate Donald Trump.\n\nTwo notable hypotheses arising from the analysis are:\n1. Bill Clinton held a prominent political role both during and after his presidency.\n2. Bill Clinton faced controversies during his administration.\n\nFor more information, you may want to explore the details of Bill Clinton's presidency, his political career timeline, or his involvement in Hillary Clinton's campaigns.\n\nSources: [7837] [7896]",

In the final NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey, Clinton held a narrow lead with 44 percent of the votes, while Trump had 40 percent (Findings 1). However, her advantage was larger in another poll, with 50 percent of the votes against Trump's 42 percent (Findings 2).\n\nBoth candidates were actively campaigning in crucial swing states. Clinton visited North Carolina, while Trump focused on Florida (Findings 3). Interestingly, around a quarter of voters in these states had already cast their ballots through early voting (Findings 4).\n\nAdditionally, the market and stock futures seemed to favor Clinton's chances during the presidential debates (Findings 5).\n\nTwo potential factors that might have influenced the campaign dynamics were the Clinton email investigation and the media and market sentiment. However, no definitive evidence was available in the corpus regarding the impact of the email investigation on Clinton's momentum (Hypotheses). The media and market sentiment appeared to lean towards a Clinton victory (Hypotheses).\n\nIf you're interested in learning more, you might want to explore the details of the Clinton email investigation, the final election results, or the campaign events in swing states (Suggested Queries).\n\nSources:",
